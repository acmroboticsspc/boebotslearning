===========================================================================

Version 3.0
July 28, 1996


--------------------
Overview
--------------------

The purpose of this utility is to analyze the EEPROM utilization of a
Stamp 1 program.  I found it necessary because a some of my Stamp 1 pro-
grams were getting very close the limit and I wanted to make sure that 
I wasn't over-running the EEPROM.  STMPSIZE is a very useful tool when
attempting to optimize Stamp 1 programs.

To use STMPSIZE you must run a Stamp 1 program that contains the BSAVE
command.  BSAVE creates a file called CODE.OBJ that is an image of the
Stamp 1 EEPROM.  STMPSIZE analyzes CODE.OBJ (or the OBJ file you specify) 
and determines space used for data (EEPROM command), free space, and space 
used by the program.  It also displays a DEBUG-type memory dump so that 
you can view ASCII characters stored in data memory.

NOTE: BSAVE will save the file before the program is downloaded to the
      Stamp 1. You do not actually need to have a Stamp connected for
      it to work.


--------------------
Using STMPSIZE
--------------------

At the DOS prompt: STMPSIZE or STMPSIZE MYFILE

If you do not specify a file name, CODE.OBJ is assumed.  If you do, 
it is not necessary (but won't hurt) to add the .OBJ extension.

Hint: Rename STMPSIZE.EXE SS.EXE for convenience.


--------------------
Examples
--------------------

I've included two demo programs and their associated OBJ files.  The 
programs each display a couple of strings on a 1x16 LCD.  The difference 
is in how the strings are stored within the program.  Notice that when 
SS1 (strings stored in LOOKUP table) is analyzed there are 92 free bytes.  
Now run STMPSIZE on SS2 (strings in data memory <EEPROM command>).  See 
the difference?  There are now 103 free bytes and the program does exactly 
the same thing!  Trust me, 11 bytes is enough to get excited about when it 
comes to the Stamp 1.
       

I hope you find this program useful.  If you have any suggestions for im-
provements, please drop me an e-mail.
