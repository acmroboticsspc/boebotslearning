' Program HUMID.BAS' The Stamp interfaces to an inexpensive temperature/humidity ' sensor kit. Data from the sensors is displayed on the host ' PC using the debug command. This program does not include ' routines for calibration or conversion, presenting instead' raw timing data from the sensors. Symbol	temp = w4	' TemperatureSymbol	RH = w5		' Humidity' The main program loop reads the sensors and displays ' the data on the PC screen until the user presses a ' key. Remember that even when the debug screen is not' displayed, the Stamp is still active. Disconnect it '  to conserve battery power. Loop: input 0:input 2: output 3low 2: low 3let temp = 500			' Start temp at a reasonable value. ReadTemp:	output 1: low 1	pause 1			' Discharge the capacitor.	input 1			' Get ready for input. 	pulsout 2,temp		' Charge the cap through temp sensor.	if pin1 = 1 then ReadRH	' If it's charged, we're done. 	let temp = temp + 1	' Else try again with wider pulse.	goto ReadTempReadRH:	high 3			' Turn on the 555 timer	pause 500		' and let it stabilize. 	pulsin 0,1,RH		' Read the pulse width.	low 3			' Kill the timer. 	debug temp		' Display the results. 	debug RH	goto Loop		' Do it all again.
