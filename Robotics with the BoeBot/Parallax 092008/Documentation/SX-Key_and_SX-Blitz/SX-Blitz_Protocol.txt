Parallax SX-Blitz
Communication Protocol v1.0

Overview
--------

Communication with the SX-Blitz requires only Tx, Rx, and Gnd
connections from the host.  All data is transceived at 57600
baud, 8 data bits, no parity bit, 1 stop bit.  On the SX-Blitz,
Rx and Tx are connected via a resistor, so every byte the host
transmits on Tx is immediately echoed back on Rx; the host must
ignore these echoed bytes.

Whenever the SX-Blitz is waiting to receive a byte, the host
has 2 seconds in which to send the byte.  If the SX-Blitz does
not receive the byte within two seconds, it aborts the current
mode and waits for a new connection.

The host should always allow 100ms to receive a byte back from
the SX-Blitz.  The exception to this rule is when the host is
waiting for a response byte from either the 'erase' or
'program' command.  In the case of erase, allow erase-time +
100ms.  In the case of program, allow program-time *
word-count + 100ms.  If a byte is not received from the
SX-Blitz within the allowed time, an error condition exists and
the host may abort the connection.

To connect to the SX-Blitz, the host must transmit the byte
sequence:

$00 $53 $58 $2D $4B $65 $79          (0,'SX-Key')

The SX-Blitz will respond with the sequence:

$53 $58 $2D $4B $65 $79 $37 $95 $FD  ('SX-Key',$37,$95,version)

At this point, the connection is established and the SX-Blitz
is ready to receive a command byte.  From this point onward,
all bytes received from the SX-Blitz must be two's-complemented
(not'd and inc'd) within the host before they may be used.

All 'words' are transceived low-byte first, then high-byte.

The commands are as follows:

$00 - end
$01 - erase
$02 - program
$03 - read
$04 - reset

Below is a list of possible error codes that may be sent by
the SX-Blitz in response to commands:

$00 = Operation successful
$01 = Vpp generation failed, waiting for new connection
$02 = Chip connection failed, waiting for new connection
$03 = Programming failed, waiting for new connection

Command Details
---------------

            $00 - end

Send this command to end your session with the SX-Blitz.  The
SX-Blitz will wait for a new connection, and not interpret the
next byte received as a command.

            $01 - erase

This command erases the entire SX device.  After sending the
erase command ($01), send a byte to specify the erase-time in
milliseconds (1 to 255).  The SX-Blitz will respond with an
error code.  If the operation is successful, the SX-Blitz will
be waiting for a new command byte.

            $02 - program

This command programs the SX device from beginning to end.
The order in which the device's words will be programmed is:

FUSEX (1 word)
FUSE (1 word)
CODE ($200/$400/$800 words)
ID (16 words)

After receiving the program command ($02), the SX-Blitz will
respond with an error code.  Assuming no error condition,
programming may proceed.

The host must then send a byte specifying the word-count
(number of sequential words to program).  This value may range
from 1 to 32.  This must be followed by another byte
specifying the programming time in milliseconds (1-255).
Then, the words to be programmed must be sent in sequence. In
order to save time, the SX-Blitz will not program $FFF values,
though they will be verified.

Upon completion of programming, the SX-Blitz will respond with
an error code.  Assuming the operation was successful, another
word-count may be sent, followed by the commensurate data and
response.

The host may end programming by sending $00 for the word-
count.  When ending programming mode, the SX-Blitz will send
a word which indicates the speed of the SX' internal RC
oscillator.  Divide the constant 1,266,035,968 by the received
word to determine the actual internal RC frequency of the SX.
This frequency may be altered by programming special bits in
the FUSEX word.  After this timing word is sent, the SX-Blitz
will send a $00 byte to signify completion of the programming
command.  It will then wait for a new command byte.

            $03 - read

This command reads the SX device from beginning to end.  The
order in which the device's words will be read is:

DEVICE (1 word)
FUSEX (1 word)
CODE ($200/$400/$800 words)
ID (16 words)

After receiving the read command ($03), the SX-Blitz will
respond with an error code.  Assuming no error condition,
reading may proceed.

The host must then send a byte specifying the word-count
(number of sequential words to read).  This value may range
from 1 to 128.  The SX-Blitz will respond by sending
the words read, followed by an error code.  Assuming no
error occurred, another word-count may be sent, followed by
the commensurate response.

The host may end reading by sending $00 for the word-count.
Upon ending reading, the SX-Blitz will respond with a timing
word and a $00 byte.  See the program command's explanation
for detail.  The SX-Blitz will then wait for a new command
byte.

            $04 - reset

This command resets the SX device by pulsing OSC1 with Vpp.

After receiving the reset command ($04), the SX-Blitz will
respond with an error code.  Assuming no error condition,
the SX-Blitz will be waiting for a new command byte.
